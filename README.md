# DotnetADBSploit
ADBSploit is an awesome tool. But it has some caveats (by some i mean none but i still wanted to rewrite that anyways bc i was bored). This is the whole ADBSploit written in C# from scratch in the meanwhile trying my best not to f*** up. I plan to use AOT for linux to minimize dotnet dependency.
