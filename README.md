# DotnetADBSploit
ADBSploit is an awesome tool. But it has some caveats (by some i mean none but i wanted to rewrite that too anyways bc i was bored). This is the whole ADBSploit written in C# from scratch in the meanwhile trying to fix those gaps. I plan to use AOT for linux to minimize dotnet dependency.
